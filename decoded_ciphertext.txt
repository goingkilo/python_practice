It was three o'clock now, and day was dawning.  I was on
a long straight grass avenue, and a hundred yards ahead
ran young Rupert, his curls waving in the fresh breeze.
I was weary and panting; he looked over his shoulder and waved
his hand again to me.  He was mocking me, for he saw he had the pace
of me. I was forced to pause for breath.  A moment later,
Rupert turned sharply to the right and was lost from my sight.

I thought all was over, and in deep vexation sank on the ground.
But I was up again directly, for a scream rang through the forest--
a woman's scream.  Putting forth the last of my strength,
I ran on to the place where he had turned out of my sight,
and, turning also, I saw him again.  But alas!  I could not touch him.
He was in the act of lifting a girl down from her horse;
doubtless it was her scream that I heard.  She looked like
a small farmer's or a peasant's daughter, and she carried
a basket on her arm.  Probably she was on her way to the
early market at Zenda.  Her horse was a stout, well shaped animal.
Master Rupert lifted her down amid her shrieks--the sight of him
frightened her; but he treated her gently, laughed, kissed her,
and gave her money.  Then he jumped on the horse, sitting sideways
like a woman; and then he waited for me.  I, on my part, waited for him.

Presently he rode towards me, keeping his distance, however.
He lifted up his hand, saying:

"What did you in the Castle?"

"I killed three of your friends," said I.

"What!  You got to the cells?"

"Yes."

"And the King?"

"He was hurt by Detchard before I killed Detchard,
but I pray that he lives."

"You fool!" said Rupert, pleasantly.

"One thing more I did."

"And what's that?"

"I spared your life.  I was behind you on the bridge,
with a revolver in my hand."

"No?  Faith, I was between two fires!"

"Get off your horse," I cried, "and fight like a man."
